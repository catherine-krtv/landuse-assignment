# Land use assignment
# Overview
This project focuses on generating, assigning, and analyzing land use zones for urban and regional planning. It incorporates spatial rules, adjacency constraints, accessibility metrics, and infrastructure considerations to produce a balanced and optimized land-use distribution.
The project utilizes Python with GeoPandas and other spatial libraries to manage, analyze, and visualize geospatial data.

# Features
Landplot splitting: Splitting one landplot on many smaller ones for future designing and assigning;

Adjacency rules: Strict spatial rules to prevent incompatible land use neighbors;

Land use assignment: Proportional distribution of land use types based on predefined ratios;

Road network generation: Create road networks based on land use zones;

Spatial visualization: Clear visualization with distinct colors and edge styles for each land use type according to the general plan

# Usage
This code will be helpful in case someone needs to assign land use for the territory that has practically no buildings on infrastructure but may be flexible in case there are other parameters (e. g. existing enterprises and roads, other Urban planning code etc.)

Outputs:

GeoJSON file with assigned land uses

Plots showing land use visualization and road networks
